# Scotch Presentation Puzzle Hunt
Welcome to my MORSE Scotch Presentation Puzzle hunt! I am a big fan of sudoku puzzles and wanted to create a couple MORSE-themed puzzles which include some sudoku variations. These are the first two puzzles I have ever created, so I hope they are fun to solve. I created them with all skill levels in mind, so even if you have not done many sudokus before hopefully you can solve them.

The rules for both puzzles are on the side panel when you open up the links below. To clarify, "normal sudoku rules apply" means that every row, column, and all nine 3x3 boxes must contain the digits 1-9 exactly once. 

I have left several clues to this link in my MORSE accounts and at my desk in the office. I am curious to see how many people find the clues and solve these puzzles in the 3 months that I am gone. **I ask that you keep this a secret until my scotch presentation so that I can see how many people find one of these clues.**

I hope you enjoy these two puzzles. If you are able to solve them, feel free to message me on Mattermost with any thoughts you had on them or any drinks you recommend I bring for my presentation (I am looking for recommendations on what to bring!). I look forward to reading all of the messages when I come back August 1st.
